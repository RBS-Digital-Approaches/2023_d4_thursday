We've used this information for everything from information retrieval tasks to predictive classification. Along the way, we've also made some passing discussions about how such annotations work to quantify or identify the semantics of those tasks (our work with POS tags, for example). But what we haven't yet done is produce a model of semantic meaning ourselves. This is another core task of NLP, and there are several different ways to approach building a statistical representation of tokens' meanings. The present section discusses one of the most popular methods of doing so: **word embeddings** also known as **word vectors**.

        "-------------------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "The word-embedding technique was first introduced in 2013, and it spawned a host of different variants that completely flooded the field of NLP until about 2018. In part, word embedding's popularity stems from the relatively simple intuition behind it, which is known as the **distributional hypothesis**: \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" (Firth). Words that appear in similar contexts, in other words, have similar meanings, and what word embeddings do is represent that context-specific information through a set of features. As a result, similar words share similar data representations, and we can leverage that similarity to explore the semantic space of a corpus, to encode documents with feature-rich data, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're familiar with [tf-idf vectors], the underlying data structure of word embeddings is the same: every word is represented by a vector of _n_ features. But a key difference lies in the **sparsity** of the vectors – or, in the case of word embeddings, the _lack_ of sparsity. As we saw in the last chapter, tf-idf vectors can suffer from the [curse of dimensionality], something that's compounded by the fact that such vectors must contain features for every word in corpus, regardless of whether a document has that word. This means tf-idf vectors are highly sparse: they contain many 0s. Word embeddings, on the other hand, do not. They're what we call **dense** representations. Each one is a fixed-length, non-sparse vector (of 50-300 dimensions, usually) that is much more information-rich than tf-idf. As a result, embeddings tend to be capable of representing more nuanced relationships between corpus words – a performance improvement that is further boosted by the fact that many of the most popular models had the advantage of being trained on billions and billions of tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other major difference between these vectors and tf-idf lies in how the former are created. While at root, word embeddings represent token co-occurence data (just like a document-term matrix), they are the product of millions of guesses made by a neural network. Training this network involves making predictions about a target word, based on that word's context. We are not going to delve into the math behind these predictions (though [this post] does); however, it is worth noting that there are two different training set ups for a word embedding model:\n",

        "2. **Skip-grams**: the network starts with the word in the middle of a window and picks random words within this window to use as its prediction targets\n",
        "\n",
        "As you may have noticed, these are just mirrored versions of one another. CBOW starts from context, while skip-gram tries to rebuild context. Regardless, in both cases the network attempts to maximize the likelihood of its predictions, updating its weights accordingly over the course of training. Words that repeatedly appear in similar contexts will help shape thse weights, and in turn the model will associate such words with similar vector representations. If you'd like to see all this in action, Xin Rong has produced a [fantastic, interactive visualization] of how word embedding models learn.\n",

        "At this point, we are at a crossroads. On the one hand, we could train a word embeddings model using our corpus documents as is. The `gensim` library offers functionality for this, and it's a relatively easy operation. On the other, we could use premade embeddings, which are usually trained on a more general – and much larger – set of documents. There is a tradeoff here:\n",
        "\n",
        "+ Training a corpus-specific model will more faithfully represent the token behavior of the texts we'd like to analyze, but these representations could be _too_ specific, especially if the model doesn't have enough data to train on; the resultant embeddings may be closer to topic models than to word-level semantics\n",
        "+ Using premade embeddings gives us the benefit of generalization: the vectors will cleave more closely to how we understand language; but such embeddings might a) miss out on certain nuances we'd like to capture, or b) introduce biases into our corpus (more on this below)\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, the decision is difficult. With this corpus, a model trained on the obituaries alone does not produce vectors that can fully demonstrate the capabilities of the word embedding technique. The corpus is just a little too specific and too small. We could've used a larger corpus, but doing so would introduce slow-downs in the workshop session. Because of this, for the analytic portions of this suession we wil use a premade model, in this case, the Stanford [GloVe] embeddings (the 200-dimension version). GloVe was trained on billions of tokens, spanning Wikipedia data, newswire articles, even Twitter.\n",

GloVe is [known to be biased] in this way. We'll show an example later on in this chapter and will discuss this in much more detail during our live session, but for now just note that the effects of bias _do_ shape how we represent our corpus, and it's important to keep an eye out for this when working with the data.\n",
