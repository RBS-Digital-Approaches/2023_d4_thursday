{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wh2j0fLvij2q"},"source":["# Deskewing pages\n","This notebook was designed to introduce one method for automatically deskewing page images in preparation for OCR. For our purposes in this iteration of the class, the details of the process are less important than seeing an example of the ways that images can be computationally changed after initial photography: when you're looking at a digital surrogate, you're seeing an image that has likely been through several processes that attempt to optimize it for the task at hand without a human having to check it at each step of the way.\n","\n","For today, there's **really** no need to try to figure out any of the details of the code: the more important thing is to get a general sense of what's happening, and then observe the differences that those changes make to the image in the end.\n","\n","The code in this notebook is drawn from a blog post by Leo Ertuna at [Becoming Human](https://becominghuman.ai/how-to-automatically-deskew-straighten-a-text-image-using-opencv-a0c30aed83df), but with an adjustment that some experimenting suggests seems to work better for early print."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"EeYTN8gDMyb9"},"source":["### A note before we start: this may not be the only problem to solve\n","The code in this notebook assumes that the problem with the page image is that it's skewed and needs to straightened—this treats the page as a two-dimensional plane.\n","\n","That works pretty well if the images are of reasonably flat pages of the kind that we can often get from the sort of imaging labs that many libraries have. But books don't necessarily lay flat, and, depending on the condition of the binding, it may not always possible to flatten the pages for imaging. So the lines of text in some images will appear not just skewed, but actually curved, due to the curvature of the pages. And pages in a book can curl in a number of ways all at once (recall, for instance how much more and how differently the pages in the middle of a thick book curl compared to pages at the beginning or end.)\n","\n","It's possible to reduce or eliminate the appearance of curvature in the lines of a page image incorporating some of techniques we'll see in this deskewing routine (but adding some others). That's a more complicated problem that we won't take on, but there's a great [blog post by Mark Zucker](https://mzucker.github.io/2016/08/15/page-dewarping.html) that walks through a solution. The blog post offers visualizations of what's happening at each step, so it's an instructive read even if you're not examining the details of the code. In the interests of time, I'll urge you **not** to examine the details of the code today, but to skim Zucker's description of his approach to the problem and look at the illustrations that visualize what the code is *doing*."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xhhbM2leRoE2"},"source":["## 1 - Connect to Google Drive, copy files, and install packages"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"vr2ZLKaBb8Kc"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Code cell #1\n","#Get access to Google Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/gdrive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kM_B4qhhc4bp"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Code cell #2\n","%cp -r /gdrive/MyDrive/rbs_digital_approaches_2023/output/cropped.zip /content/cropped.zip\n","%cd /content/\n","!unzip cropped.zip"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"h5kdzNrKcbUL"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Code cell #3\n","#Install IPyWidgets to provide widgets for experimenting with some variables later\n","import ipywidgets as widgets\n","from ipywidgets import interact\n","\n","#Import necessary Python packages for use in our code.\n","\n","#Note that opencv-python is installed by default in Google Colaboratory.

(He notes, though, that other approaches are possible. One might find that the angle of a different block yielded better results, or the average of multiple blocks.) This seems like it would be a pretty sound approach if we were dealing with deskewing, say, a page printed from a laser printer that had subsequently been scanned with the paper skewed slightly on a scanner bed.\n","\n","But while this approach seemed to work well for images from a copy of *Sophonisba* from the University of Pennsylvania that were significantly skewed, it actually seemed to make things slightly *worse* for some pages that were only minimally skewed. I'm not entirely sure what to make of this yet, but my hunch is that this result may arise from the character of pages produced on a printing press.

At a practical level, the file sizes for black and white images are much smaller than for color images.

Automated methods for figuring out likely-optimal values for thresholding any given image are necessary to do this kind of work at scale, but can lead to sometimes unexpected results.\n","\n","When you're working with digital surrogates that have been converted to black and white, it's important to think about how the images may have been transformed so that you can try to work backwards to an at least plausible mental picture of the properties of the source item."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
